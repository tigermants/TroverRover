          <p>Trover Rover is an interactive and educational game, focused on the importance of animal conservation.</p>
          <p>Roving around the world, you can find animals, complete quests and learn more and more!</p>
          <p>This game wouldn't be possible without the public online database Trove, the source of all the information provided in the game.</p>
          <p>See how much of Trove's animal information you can explore, whether its up in the trees or hiding behind a rock!</p>
          <p>Make sure your teacher or parents have given you permission to play!</p>
          <p>Let the roving begin!</p>

          <p><h3>All about Conservation</h3></p>
          <p>So you think you've caught them all? Well that's only on Trover Rover! The very same animals are out there but they don't have you to save them and soon you might not be able to.</p>
          <p>There are many endangered animals in Australia but you can still help them!</p>
          <p>To find out more, visit the website below. Ask your teacher or parent's permission before you do.</p>
          <h4>More information</h4>

        <div id="help">
          <p>Catch animals and put them in your conservation area.</p>
          <p>You do this by roving around using the arrows!</p>
          <img src="images/arrows.png" style="width:100px"/>
          <p>Different animals live in particular areas so look around and see what you find!</p>
          <p>(Wait, do birds live in the water?)</p>
          <p>Completing the quests listed at the bottom will improve your stats but you don’t have to follow these.</p>
          <p>When you come into contact with an animal, you've got to try and catch it!</p>
          <p>Click on the most correct food or item in your backpack that would most likely draw the animal closer and you might just get it!</p>
          <p>Good luck!</p>
